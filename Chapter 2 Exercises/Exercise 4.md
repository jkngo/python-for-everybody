# Exercise 4: Assume that we execute the following assignment statements:
```
width = 17
height = 12.0
```
For each of the following expressions, write the value of the expression and the type (of the value of the expression).

1. width//2
2. width/2.0
3. height/3
4. 1 + 2 * 5

Use the Python interpreter to check your answers.

## Solution
1. 8
'8' is an integer, defined a 'whole number.'

2. 8.5
'8.5' is of the class 'float', so it will be evaluated as a 'float' with a decimal.

3. 4.0
'4.0' has the class 'float', so it will be evaluated as a 'float' with a decimal.

4. 11
